# Release Readiness v0.1

## What v0.1 Must Prove

Rygnal Core should prove this workflow:

```
Tool request
→ Risk assessment
→ Policy decision
→ Approval workflow if needed
→ Audit logging
→ Safe execution or block
→ Clear CLI output
```

## Required Validation Commands

Run these before release:

```
ruff format src tests demo
ruff check src tests demo
pytest -q
bandit -r src demo -c pyproject.toml
pip-audit -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m demo.run_demo
```

## Docker Validation

Run these before release:

```
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm rygnal pytest -q
docker compose run --rm rygnal python -m demo.run_demo
```
